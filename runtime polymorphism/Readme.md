Runtime polymorphism is achieved only through a pointer (or reference) of the base class type.................................
Also, a base class pointer can point to the objects of the base class as well as to the objects of the derived class,, but we can only access base class members using the base class pointer,, The base class pointer can't acess the derived class memebers even the base pointer is pointing to derive class object........................................

VIRTUAL keyword allow to execute the derive class function with the same name instead of using base class function to do run-time polymorphism.
